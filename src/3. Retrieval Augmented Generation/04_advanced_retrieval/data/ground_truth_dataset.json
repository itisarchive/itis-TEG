    "question": "What is Einstein's theory of relativity about?",
    "ground_truth": "Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity is actually two closely related theories\u2014special relativity (1905) and general relativity (1915)\u2014that together replaced the old Newtonian ideas of absolute space and time and gave a new, geometric picture of space, time and gravity.\n\nSpecial relativity\n- Domain: physics in the absence of gravity, for observers moving at constant velocity (inertial frames).\n- Core postulates:\n  1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames.\n  2. The speed of light in vacuum is the same constant (c) for all observers, regardless of their motion relative to the light source.\n- Main consequences:\n  - Space and time are not separate: they form a single four-dimensional spacetime. Events that are simultaneous for one observer may not be simultaneous for another (relativity of simultaneity).\n  - Time dilation: a moving clock ticks more slowly as seen by a stationary observer.\n  - Length contraction: objects moving relative to an observer are measured to be shorter in the direction of motion.\n  - Lorentz transformations replace the Galilean transforms and quantify how coordinates change between moving observers.\n  - Mass\u2013energy equivalence: E = mc\u00b2, showing mass is a form of energy and providing the quantitative link between them.\n- Confirmations: particle lifetimes (muons), precise clock experiments (Hafele\u2013Keating), behavior of high-energy particles in accelerators.\n\nGeneral relativity\n- Domain: includes gravity and accelerated motion; it is a theory of gravitation.\n- Core idea: gravity is not a force acting at a distance (as in Newtonian physics) but a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime produced by mass-energy. Matter and energy tell spacetime how to curve; curved spacetime tells matter how to move.\n- Technical statement (in words): the distribution of mass-energy determines the geometry of spacetime via Einstein\u2019s field equations, so free-falling objects follow geodesics (the straightest possible paths) in curved spacetime.\n- Key concepts and implications:\n  - Equivalence principle: locally (in a small region) the effects of gravity are indistinguishable from acceleration.\n  - Gravitational time dilation: clocks run slower in stronger gravitational potentials.\n  - Light deflection: light is bent when it passes near massive bodies (gravitational lensing).\n  - Perihelion precession: explains anomalous advance of Mercury\u2019s perihelion that Newtonian gravity could not fully account for.\n  - Black holes: regions of spacetime from which nothing (not even light) can escape, predicted solutions of the field equations.\n  - Cosmology: provides the framework for modern models of the expanding universe (Big Bang cosmology).\n  - Gravitational waves: ripples in spacetime generated by accelerating masses; predicted by general relativity and directly detected in 2015.\n- Relation to Newton: In the weak-field, slow-speed limit (relative to c), general relativity reproduces Newtonian gravity as an excellent approximation.\n\nWhy it matters\n- Conceptual shift: replaced absolute notions of time and space with spacetime and made gravity geometric.\n- Broad impact: underpins modern astrophysics and cosmology, is essential for precise technologies (e.g., GPS must correct for relativistic time effects), and has been repeatedly confirmed by experiments and observations.\n\nIn short: special relativity redefines how space and time relate for observers in uniform motion and links mass and energy; general relativity extends that framework to include gravity by describing it as curvature of spacetime produced by mass-energy, yielding a wide range of testable predictions about the universe."

    "question": "What are Newton's three laws of motion?",
    "ground_truth": "Newton\u2019s three laws of motion (formulated by Sir Isaac Newton in the Principia, 1687) are the fundamental principles of classical mechanics. Stated and explained:\n\n1) First law (Law of inertia)\n- Statement: A body at rest remains at rest, and a body in motion continues in uniform straight\u2011line motion, unless acted on by a net external force.\n- Explanation: This defines inertial reference frames and introduces mass as a measure of an object\u2019s resistance to changes in motion (inertia). If the vector sum of all forces on an object is zero, its velocity is constant (which may be zero).\n- Example: A puck slides at constant speed on frictionless ice; it will keep moving straight unless a force (friction, a bump, etc.) changes its motion.\n\n2) Second law (Law of acceleration)\n- Statement: The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the net external force applied and occurs in the direction of that force.\n- Mathematical form: \u03a3F = dp/dt. For constant mass m this reduces to the familiar \u03a3F = m a, where a is acceleration and \u03a3F is the vector sum of external forces.\n- Explanation: This law quantifies how forces produce acceleration; it is the operational definition of force in mechanics.\n- Example: Pushing a shopping cart: the larger the net force, the larger the acceleration; heavier carts (larger m) accelerate less for the same force.\n- Units: Force in SI is the newton (N), where 1 N = 1 kg\u00b7m/s\u00b2.\n\n3) Third law (Action and reaction)\n- Statement: For every force exerted by body A on body B there is an equal in magnitude and opposite in direction force exerted by B on A.\n- Explanation: Forces come in pairs that act on different bodies. This is the basis for momentum conservation in isolated systems.\n- Example: When two billiard balls collide, the force on ball A from ball B equals and opposes the force on B from A. A rocket pushes exhaust gas one way and is propelled the opposite way; when the exhaust gas is included as the second body, momentum is conserved and the third law holds.\n\nImportant clarifications and limits\n- The laws assume an inertial (non\u2011accelerating) reference frame and are classical (non\u2011relativistic). At speeds near the speed of light or in strong gravitational fields, relativistic mechanics replaces Newtonian laws.\n- The second law in full generality is \u03a3F = dp/dt and therefore handles variable mass systems (e.g., rockets) correctly; the simple \u03a3F = m a assumes constant mass.\n- In electromagnetism and in field theories, apparent violations of the third law occur if only material bodies are considered; including the momentum carried by fields restores overall momentum conservation.\n- Within their domain (everyday macroscopic velocities and distances), Newton\u2019s three laws accurately predict motion and underlie classical mechanics."

    "question": "What did Charles Darwin discover?",
    "ground_truth": "Charles Darwin\u2019s central discovery was that species change over time by a natural process he called natural selection \u2014 and that all living species descend, with modification, from common ancestors.\n\nWhat that means and how he showed it\n- Descent with modification: Darwin concluded that the diversity of life arises because lineages split and change over generations; modern species are related by common ancestry rather than having been created independently.  \n- Natural selection as the mechanism: he proposed that individuals in a population vary in heritable traits; those variants that confer an advantage in a given environment tend to survive and reproduce more successfully, so beneficial traits become more common over generations. This explained adaptation and the origin of complex features without invoking purposive design.  \n- Evidence base: Darwin marshaled extensive evidence from biogeography, comparative anatomy, embryology, the fossil record, and breeding/domestication experiments. Key observational inputs came from his five-year voyage on HMS Beagle (1831\u20131836), including the Gal\u00e1pagos finches and island tortoises, fossils of extinct South American mammals, and variation among related species in different environments.  \n- Sexual selection: he also proposed sexual selection \u2014 competition for mates and mate choice \u2014 as a distinct evolutionary force that explains traits that improve mating success even if they are costly for survival (e.g., elaborate plumage).\n\nMajor publications and contributions\n- On the Origin of Species (1859): Darwin\u2019s landmark book presented the theory, the mechanism of natural selection, and a vast compilation of supporting observations and arguments.  \n- Later work: Darwin extended evolutionary ideas to explain sexual selection and published detailed experimental and observational studies on plants (e.g., cross- and self-fertilization, climbing plants, insectivorous plants, orchid pollination), coral reefs and geology, and patterns of variation and hybridism.\n\nContext and impact\n- Darwin did not invent the idea that species change, but he provided the first comprehensive, evidence-based mechanism (natural selection) and an enormous empirical foundation. Alfred Russel Wallace independently conceived a similar mechanism, and Wallace\u2019s work helped precipitate Darwin\u2019s 1859 publication.  \n- Darwin\u2019s theory transformed biology: it provides the unifying framework for understanding biodiversity, adaptation, speciation, and the relationships among organisms, and it underpins modern fields such as evolutionary biology, genetics, ecology, and comparative anatomy.\n\nIn short: Darwin discovered and demonstrated that life evolves by descent with modification and that natural selection is a primary mechanism driving that evolutionary change."

    "question": "What was Ada Lovelace's contribution to computing?",
    "ground_truth": "Ada Lovelace\u2019s key contribution to computing was her clear exposition of the idea of a general-purpose programmable machine and the publication of the first algorithm written specifically for such a machine.\n\nMain points:\n- In 1842\u201343 she translated an Italian paper by Luigi Menabrea describing Charles Babbage\u2019s proposed Analytical Engine and, at Babbage\u2019s suggestion, added extensive notes of her own. Her notes were three times longer than the original article and gave technical detail and examples that expanded the paper\u2019s ideas.\n- In those notes she published an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. That algorithm is regarded as the first published computer program \u2014 an explicit set of instructions intended to be executed by a machine.\n- Lovelace went beyond number\u2011crunching: she explained how \u201ccodes\u201d could be created so the Engine could handle letters and symbols as well as numbers, and she foresaw applications such as music and graphics. In other words, she grasped and articulated the concept of a machine that could manipulate symbols according to rules \u2014 a general\u2011purpose computer \u2014 not merely a calculator.\n- Her writings also reflect her effort to combine mathematical rigor with imaginative insight (her \u201cpoetical science\u201d), a perspective that anticipated later developments in computing theory and applications.\n\nLegacy:\n- For much of the 19th and early 20th centuries her work was little known; mid\u201120th\u2011century republication of her notes restored recognition of her role. Today she is widely celebrated as the first computer programmer and a visionary about what computing machines could become (the Ada programming language and Ada Lovelace Day are named in her honor)."
